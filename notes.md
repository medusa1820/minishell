Below, I'll visualize this with more detailed descriptions:

Root Node (new_node_head)

Type: AST_NODE_PIPE
Content: None
Left Child: Points to new_node_left
Right Child: Points to new_node_right
Details: This node represents a pipe operation that connects the commands from the left child to the right child.
Left Child (new_node_left)

Type: AST_NODE_CMD
Content:
stdin_redirect: None
stdout_redirect: None
assignments: None
cmd: ["ls", "-la"]
Left Child: None
Right Child: None
Details: This node represents the command "ls -la." There are no redirections or assignments for this command.
Right Child (new_node_right)

Type: AST_NODE_CMD
Content:
stdin_redirect: None
stdout_redirect: None
assignments: None
cmd: ["grep", "1"]
Left Child: None
Right Child: None
Details: This node represents the command "grep 1." There are no redirections or assignments for this command.

Here's a more visual representation:

          [Root Node]
       AST_NODE_PIPE
        /           \
       /             \
[Left Child]   [Right Child]
AST_NODE_CMD   AST_NODE_CMD
 "ls -la"       "grep 1"

This tree represents the shell command ls -la | grep 1. If the AST were expanded to support more shell features, you could build much more complex command structures.

If you would like me to explain anything further, or if you have any specific questions about the code, please let me know!
